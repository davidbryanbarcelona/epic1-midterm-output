        ABOUT THE MANDALA ART:
   :art: The basic shapes in this mandala art are circles and squares. I chose these shapes as the major elements 
   for this art because of the symbolism of these shapes. The circle represents freedom, and the square represents 
   equality. In this art, I used different methods and classes to incorporate all the necessary patterns.Â
